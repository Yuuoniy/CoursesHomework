### Matrix Homework - C 程序设计 （Ⅰ）  
### Matrix Homework -C++ 程序设计（Ⅱ）


Matix is a SYSU oj, most of our homework is on it.  
ues ※ to mark some exercise I think great.  
For each assignment, here is the content:  

| content| description |
|--------|--------|
|Latest Submission        |     latest submission in oj, I am sure it is accepted.
|Provided Codes| Some codes are provided, we are supposed to implement specific functions or complete some files basing on them.|
|Tests|test files|
|Description|description about the question,some learning advice and sources are also provided here(by TA's)|

Chances are that format of output isn't directly shown, studying provided codes or submitting for several times to know that is common. 



I strongly recommend reading **Description** first.  
PS: Some of our TAs are fond of dresses, it's no surprising to see some assginments are relative to the special hobby and based on personal experience.
Well, just for fun, or maybe that's really true.
