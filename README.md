### Matrix Homework - C 程序设计 （Ⅰ）  
### Matrix Homework -C++ 程序设计（Ⅱ）


Matix is a SYSU oj, most of our homework is on it.  
ues ※ to mark some exercise I think great.  
For each assignment, here is the content:  

| content| description |
|--------|--------|
|Latest Submission        |     latest submission in oj, I am sure it is accepted.
|Provided Codes| Some codes are provided, we are supposed to implement specific functions or compelete some files(it's flexible) basing on them.|
|Tests|test files|
|Description|description about the question,some learning advice and sources are also provided here(by dear TA's)|

Chances are that format of output isn't directly shown, studying provided codes or submitting for several times to know that is common. 



I strongly recommend reading **Description** first.
